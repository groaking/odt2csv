# odt2csv
This Python script converts an ODT file generated by an OOMMF (http://math.nist.gov/oommf/) into a CSV data file for better compatibility with more modern applications.

# Features

The script can detect data rows and column header in an OOMMF ODT file, remove excessive space characters, and separate each data value with commas in no time. It has been tested to convert a 69.7 MiB ODT file into CSV in 1.9 second using home laptop.

# Issues

- The script is yet to convert multiple ODT files simultaneously.
- The GUI version of this script is yet to be introduced.

# Installation

To run `odt2csv`, simply install the latest Python version from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and execute the following conveniently in the same directory where the `odt2csv.py` file is located:

```sh
python odt2csv.py -i input.odt -o output.csv
```

Replace `input.odt` and `output.csv` accordingly.
